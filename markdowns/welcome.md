# Welcome!

This is an exercise used to practice TDD. In this exercise, we'll build a simple AI for Marvin the Depressed Android.

Marvin should follow some simple rules:

1. Marvin responds to most things with "Whatever."
2. Marvin responds to questions with "I don't care."
3. Marvin responds to silence with "Fine. Waste my time."
4. Marvin responds to yelling with "You don't have to yell. I'm right here."

Advanced: Marvin responds to "Was willst du essen?" with "Mir egal." Hint: this is the start of more robust functionality.
